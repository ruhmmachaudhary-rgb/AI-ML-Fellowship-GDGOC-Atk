Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all about making machines think and act like humans. Machine Learning (ML) is a part of AI that helps computers learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning (DL) takes ML further by using neural networks to handle really complex tasks. Data Science uses AI and ML to explore data and find useful insights. In simple terms, AI is the big picture, ML is a way to achieve it, and DL is a powerful tool within ML.
