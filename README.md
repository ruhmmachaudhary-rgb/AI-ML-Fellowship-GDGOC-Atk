# AI-ML Fellowship – Weekly Progress

##  Week 1 – Python & GitHub Fundamentals

In Week 1, I learned the basics of GitHub and Python programming.

###  GitHub Concepts

* Learned how to create a repository.
* Understood the purpose of branches and how they help manage different versions of a project.
* Practiced uploading files and organizing project folders.
* Learned how to commit changes and keep track of project updates.

###  Python OOP Concepts

* Encapsulation: Protecting data within a class.
* Inheritance: Creating child classes from a parent class to reuse code.
* Polymorphism: Using the same method name with different behaviors.
* Classes & Objects: Understanding how real-world entities can be modeled in Python.

 This week built my foundation in programming and version control.

##  Week 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In Week 2, I focused on understanding datasets and analyzing data using Python libraries.

###  Dataset Understanding

* Learned how to load and inspect datasets.
* Explored data types, columns, and dataset structure.

###  Libraries Used

* NumPy: For numerical operations.
* Pandas:For data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn:For creating meaningful visualizations.

###  Data Preparation

* Performed data cleaning by handling missing values.
* Applied preprocessing techniques to improve data quality.

###  Data Visualization

* Created graphs to identify patterns and trends.
* Used visual insights to better understand the dataset.

 This week strengthened my data analysis skills and improved my ability to extract insights from data.
