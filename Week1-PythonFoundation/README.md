# Mini Quiz App - Week 1 Python Foundation

This is a small project I made for Week 1 of the AI/ML Fellowship. It is a simple mini quiz app built using Python classes and Streamlit.

What I Learned and Did
- Practiced Python basics: variables, loops, conditions, and functions
- Learned OOP concepts: created Question and Quiz classes
- Used Streamlit to make a simple interactive app
- Implemented multiple-choice questions and calculated the score

How to Run
1. Activate the virtual environment: venv Scripts activate.bat
2. Install Streamlit if not already installed: pip install streamlit
3. Run the app: python -m streamlit run miniquiz-app.py
4. The quiz will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501

- Code is kept simple and beginner-friendly

This project helped me practice Python, OOP, and creating small interactive apps using Streamlit.
